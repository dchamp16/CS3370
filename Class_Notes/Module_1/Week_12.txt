compile time code generation
    - sepearate code version are automatically generated
    - On-demand code generation
        - implicit and explicit
    - potential for code bloat

template parameters
    - type parameters
        -  the most common
        sample:

        template <typename T>
        size_t size_of() {
          return sizeof(T);
        }

    - non-type
        - compile time intergral values
        sample:

        template <typename T, size_t N>
        std::vector<T> first_n(const std::vector<T>& v) {
          std::vector<T> result(N);
          for (size_t i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            result[i] = v[i];
          }
          return result;
        }

    - template
        - template template paramters
        sample:

        template <template <typename> class T>
        std::vector<T<int>> create_vector() {
          std::vector<T<int>> v;
          v.push_back(T<int>(1));
          v.push_back(T<int>(2));
          v.push_back(T<int>(3));
          return v;
        }

program 7

use threads

step1 generate random integered - random integer queue ->
step 2 filter out multiples of 3 - with no multiple of 3 ->
step 3 group ints to 10 files

concurrency
    - Concurrency is like a single-lane bridge that can handle one car at a time. However, cars can still pass each other at different points on the bridge, giving the illusion of multiple cars moving simultaneously.
    - Ability of a program to have multiple tasks that can make progress independently
    - Can be achieved on a single-core processor
    - Can improve the responsiveness of a program
    - Can be more complex to implement than sequential code
paralelism
    - Parallelism is like a multi-lane bridge where multiple cars can move simultaneously, utilizing the available lanes to improve traffic flow.
    - Ability of a program to have multiple tasks that are running at the same time on different hardware resources
    - Requires multiple hardware resources, such as multiple cores or processors
    - Can improve the throughput of a program
    - Can be more complex to implement than concurrent code
