type 
    - defines a set ofvalues with associated operation

value 
    - is set a bit interpreted as some type

object 
    - is some memory that holds a value of some type

varibales 
    - is names object

x = y
L  R = value

constexpr 
    - bound to literal
enum {n = 7}; - n is an rvalue() (no memory used)

unsigned - ?

size_t (#include <cstddef>) - when unsigned quantity

** 
    - maybe will the array contain of pointer elements

const qualifier
    - indicated that the item will not change in the current scope

when incrementing the address it depends on the type size

void pointer
    - if you dont know what type

primitive type:
    - built in types

reference 
    - copies the value

strcpy
    - unsafe
    - what if the destination does not have enough room reserved for the string being copied?
    - it keeps going!
